        "The project on Predicting Hospital Readmissions and Improving Patient Outcomes is important in examining in the practical scenario of the health care system. The readmissions are not only very expensive, currently running at billions of dollars per year, but also are an indicator of the quality of patient care. In this way, the most common reasons for readmissions can be noted and subsequent targeted measures with the focus onthe provision of additional appropriate health care services can be implemented. For instance, the prediction models can help identify patients who need extra checkups or inform one how some specific patients discharge plan can be made.\n",

        "This project is rather appealing because, utilising state of the art technology, it solves a real problem that exists in the modern hospital and health systems around the world. In this context, it was possible to avoid unnecessary readmissions, improve the patient experience and address comorbidities, demographics, medication adherence, and social determinants of Health through the project. In addition, it squarely fits into evolving virtuous health models, such as value-based care, where hospitals receive compensation based on the outcomes accomplished without reference to the quantity. The outputs generated from this project might help to engage and shape policies, target funding strategies, and even potentially result in technological applications, such as real-time clinician-facing dashboards. The integration of technology, cost AND patient care makes this a relevant, exciting project in the field of healthcare.\n"
