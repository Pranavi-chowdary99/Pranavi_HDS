        "I wanted to work on a topic like, Predicting Hospital Readmissions and Improving Patient Outcomes this will helps to reduce the cost of the patients and prevent and identifies the cause of the readmissions in hospitals\n",
        "\n",
        "This topic aims at detecting readmission factors within hospital and subsequent work towards the enhancement of patient clinical outcomes, and it's very useful in the real-world context of healthcare delivery. The depth of hospital readmissions is a large financial occurrence with its magnitude of billions of shillings and is regarded as a measure of patients care in healthcare provision. Therefore the paper aims at establishing the odds regarding readmissions that will help the healthcare providers to come up with a right plan in order to enhance the care plan given to the patients, increase the health standards of the patients as well as efficiently use the available resources. For example, predictive models can warn clinicians of such patients to look out for and recommend more check-ups or offer data on tailoring discharge plans.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this reason, this topic is fascinating because it aligns with the use of predictive analytics in practice and targets a real problem of the health-care organizations globally. Using tools such as demographic characteristics, comorbidities, medication compatibility, and SDoH, the project may ensure that there was reduction in the number of avoidable readmissions while at the same time improving patient satisfaction. Moreover, it correlates effectively with the value-based care agendas that offer hospitals incentives that encourage them to stop focusing on the number of cases treated. The discovery resulted from this project might help shape policies, dictate distribution of resources, and create technological aids such as actual-time tracking interfaces for clinicians. The technological solution, cost optimization and, in particular, the care for patients define this as a highly relevant and interesting business process in healthcare.\n"
